========================

Online Sketching Hashing (OSH) is a online hashing approach for large-scale datasets with low computation and storage cost, while maintaining comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods.

We provide the Matlab code of our OSH method, together with CIFAR-10 dataset. With all files in place, you may run "scRunCIFAR.m" to see how our method works.

We also tested our approach on GIST-1M (not provided due to the space limitation) and a synthetic dataset (dataset generation code is also provided).
