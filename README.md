========================

Online Sketching Hashing (OSH) is a online hashing approach for large-scale datasets with low computation and storage cost, while maintaining comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods.

We have provided the Matlab code of our OSH method, together with the CIFAR-10 dataset. With all the files in place, you may run "scRunCIFAR.m" to see how our method works.

Our approach has also been tested on GIST-1M (dataset not provided due to the space limitation) and a synthetic dataset (dataset generation code is also provided). You can prepare the corresponding *.mat files to run our method on these datasets.
